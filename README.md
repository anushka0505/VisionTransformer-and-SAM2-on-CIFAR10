# VisionTransformer-and-SAM2-on-CIFAR10
This repository contains solutions for two tasks: Q1: Implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch on CIFAR-10 using PyTorch, following “An Image is Worth 16x16 Words” (Dosovitskiy et al., ICLR 2021). Q2: Text-driven image segmentation using SAM 2 with text prompts converted to region seeds via CLIP-based models.
